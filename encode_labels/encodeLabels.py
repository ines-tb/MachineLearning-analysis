# ENCODING (a preprocessing step)
# Scikit-learnâ€™s machine learning algorithms, the text features 
# (month, education, and gender) will have to be converted 
# into numbers. This process is called encoding.

# WITH PANDAS :
# ***********************
# Encoding Gender (get_dummies method)
loans_binary_encoded = pd.get_dummies(loans_df, columns=["gender"])
loans_binary_encoded.head()

# %%
# Encoding multiple columns:
loans_binary_encoded = pd.get_dummies(loans_df, columns=["education", "gender"])
loans_binary_encoded.head()

# %%
# WITH SKLEARN:
# ***********************
# the encoding is performed in the same column with valuese 0-n instead of
# one column per value with 0-1 
le = LabelEncoder()
df2 = loans_df.copy()
df2['education'] = le.fit_transform(df2['education'])

# CUSTOM ENCODING:
# *************************
# For example to encode months we want Jan=1, Jul=7, Oct=10, etc...
# instead of random assignment that happens with LabelEncoder as we can see below
loans_df['month_le'] = le.fit_transform(loans_df['month'])
